Master: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rindow/rindow-messaging.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rindow/rindow-messaging)

"Rindow messaging" abstracts methods of synchronous communication and asynchronous communication between programs, so that various messaging services can be operated in the same procedure.

In general, it supports Message operation template, but it can also be used as a standalone library.

Driver for messaging service is required separately, but it includes special emulation service of Queue using SQL databases.
